### Emittance preservation of an electron bunch in a loaded quasi-linear plasma wakefield

**Abstract**<br>
TWe investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge electron beam being accelerated in quasi-linear plasma wakefield driven by a short proton beam. The structure of the wakefield is similar to that of a long, modulated proton beam. By selecting transverse and longitudinal electron beam parameters in order to  appropriately load of the wake, we show that the bulk of the electron beam can be accelerated without significant emittance growth.
