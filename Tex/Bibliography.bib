	abstract = {We describe {OSIRIS}, a three-dimensional, relativistic, massively parallel, object oriented particle-in-cell code for modeling plasma based accelerators. Developed in Fortran 90, the code runs on multiple platforms (Cray T3E, {IBM} {SP}, Mac clusters) and can be easily ported to new ones. Details on the code’s capabilities are given. We discuss the object-oriented design of the code, the encapsulation of system dependent code and the parallelization of the algorithms involved. We also discuss the implementation of communications as a boundary condition problem and other key characteristics of the code, such as the moving window, open-space and thermal bath boundaries, arbitrary domain decomposition, 2D (cartesian and cylindric) and 3D simulation modes, electron sub-cycling, energy conservation and particle and field diagnostics. Finally results from three-dimensional simulations of particle and laser wakefield accelerators are presented, in connection with the data analysis and visualization infrastructure developed to post-process the scalar and vector results from {PIC} simulations.},

	abstract = {Using parameters from the {AWAKE} project and particle-in-cell simulations we investigate beam loading of a plasma wake driven by a self-modulated proton beam. Addressing the case of injection of an electron witness bunch after the drive beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma, we optimise witness bunch parameters of size, charge and injection phase to maximise energy gain and minimise relative energy spread and emittance of the accelerated bunch.},

We address the case of injection after the proton beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma. Optimal parameters for the injected electron bunch in terms of initial beam energy and beam charge density are investigated and evaluated in terms of witness bunch energy and energy spread. An approximate modulated proton beam is emulated in order to reduce computation time in these simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the conceptual steps in reaching the design of the {AWAKE} experiment currently under construction at {CERN}. We start with an introduction to plasma wakefield acceleration and the motivation for using proton drivers. We then describe the self-modulation instability – a key to an early realization of the concept. This is then followed by the historical development of the experimental design, where the critical issues that arose and their solutions are described. We conclude with the design of the experiment as it is being realized at {CERN} and some words on the future outlook. A summary of the {AWAKE} design and construction status as presented in this conference is given in Gschwendtner et al. [1].},
