	abstract = {We describe OSIRIS, a three-dimensional, relativistic, massively parallel, object oriented particle-in-cell code for modeling plasma based accelerators. Developed in Fortran 90, the code runs on multiple platforms (Cray T3E, IBM SP, Mac clusters) and can be easily ported to new ones. Details on the code’s capabilities are given. We discuss the object-oriented design of the code, the encapsulation of system dependent code and the parallelization of the algorithms involved. We also discuss the implementation of communications as a boundary condition problem and other key characteristics of the code, such as the moving window, open-space and thermal bath boundaries, arbitrary domain decomposition, 2D (cartesian and cylindric) and 3D simulation modes, electron sub-cycling, energy conservation and particle and field diagnostics. Finally results from three-dimensional simulations of particle and laser wakefield accelerators are presented, in connection with the data analysis and visualization infrastructure developed to post-process the scalar and vector results from PIC simulations.},

We address the case of injection after the proton beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma. Optimal parameters for the injected electron bunch in terms of initial beam energy and beam charge density are investigated and evaluated in terms of witness bunch energy and energy spread. An approximate modulated proton beam is emulated in order to reduce computation time in these simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the conceptual steps in reaching the design of the AWAKE experiment currently under construction at CERN. We start with an introduction to plasma wakefield acceleration and the motivation for using proton drivers. We then describe the self-modulation instability – a key to an early realization of the concept. This is then followed by the historical development of the experimental design, where the critical issues that arose and their solutions are described. We conclude with the design of the experiment as it is being realized at CERN and some words on the future outlook. A summary of the AWAKE design and construction status as presented in this conference is given in Gschwendtner et al. [1].},

	abstract = {Transverse emittance is a crucial feature of laser-wakefield accelerators, yet accurately reproducing its value in numerical simulations remains challenging. It is shown here that, when the charge of the bunch exceeds a few tens of picocoulombs, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations erroneously overestimate the emittance. This is mostly due the interaction of spurious Cherenkov radiation with the bunch, which leads to a steady growth of emittance during the simulation. A new computational scheme is proposed, which is free of spurious Cherenkov radiation. It can be easily implemented in existing PIC codes and leads to a substantial reduction of the emittance growth.},
