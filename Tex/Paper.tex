We investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge electron beam being accelerated in quasi-linear
plasma wakefield driven by a short proton beam. The structure of the wakefield is similar to that of a long, modulated
proton beam. By selecting transverse and longitudinal electron beam parameters in order to appropriately load the wake,
we show that the bulk of the electron beam can be accelerated without significant emittance growth.

\section[\label{S:I}]{Introduction}
% interested from SMI/AWAKE
% requirements for AWAKE Run 2
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

Beam driven plasma wakefield accelerators have the potential to offer compact linear accelerators with high energy
gradients, and has been of interest for several decades \cite{chen:1985}. A relativist beam travelling through a plasma
will excite a strong longitudinal e-field that can be loaded by a trailing witness beam, which can achieve a high
acceleration gradient. Acceleration of an electron beam by an electron drive bunch has been demonstrated experimentally
\cite{rosenzweig:1988, blumenfeld:2007, kallos:2008} in the past. The AWAKE experiment at CERN is a proof of concept
proton driven plasma wakefield accelerator \cite{awake_collaboration:2014}.

A major challenge with plasma wakefield accelerators is, however, to produce an accelerated beam with a minimal increase
in energy spread and emittance. In the well described linear case where the beam density $n_{b}$ is much smaller than
the plasma density $n_{0}$ the plasma causes emittance growth in the beam. A finite length beam will also see a varying
transverse wakefield causing increasing energy spread \cite{katsouleas:1987}. In the non-linear regime, where
$n_{b} > n_{0}$, the drive beam sees an unvarying transverse field due to a bubble forming in the plasma behind the
drive beam. The bubble is formed by the transverse oscillations of the plasma electrons which move near uniformly as a
function of distance from the drive beam forming a sheet around an evacuated area. Since the much heavier plasma ions
have no significant movement within the relevant time frame, these remaining ion channel creates a focusing force that
scales linearly with the radius within this bubble producing a angularly symmetric focusing force
\cite{lu:2006-1, lu:2006}. This effect also avoid the issue of increasing energy spread due to transverse beam loading.
Increase in energy spread is still dependent on beam loading of the longitudinal e-field, $E_{z}$. This effect can be
negated by specially shaped beams \cite{katsouleas:1987, tzoufras:2009}, but this is difficult experimentally and is not
a topic explored in this paper.

A train of electron drive bunches with a separation $\lambda_{pe}$ and a length $l_{b} \ll \lambda_{pe}$, where
$\lambda_{p} = 2\pi c/\omega_{pe}$ and $\omega_{pe} = (n_{0} e^{2} / m_{e} \epsilon_{0})^{1/2}$, will drive an
increasingly strong field $E_{z}$ for each bunch \cite{chen:1985}. A tailing witness beam loading the peak accelerating
phase of this field will quickly gain energy from the wakefield. Acceleration of an electron witness beam driven by two
electron drive beams was demonstrated at Brookhaven National Laboratory \cite{muggli:2011}. However, electron drive
bunches will quickly lose energy to the plasma, and the accelerating witness beam will eventually catch up with the
drive beam and the acceleration stop.

This de-phasing problem can be minimised by instead using a proton drive bunch \cite{caldwell:2009}. Proton beams, like
for instance the LHC and SPS beams at CERN, are ideal candidates for such an accelerator; however, they are orders of
magnitude longer than the plasma wavelengths needed for such applications. This issue is resolved by letting the proton
beam undergo self-modulation before injecting the witness beam into one of the buckets in the modulated structure. This
self-modulation instability is caused by the transverse fields generated by the beam acting upon the beam itself,
causing regions of the beam to rapidly defocus \cite{kumar:2010}. The modulation frequency is close to that of the
plasma, leaving a train of proton bunches along the beam axis.

\subsection[\label{S:I:AWAKE}]{The AWAKE Experiment}
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

The AWAKE experiment, currently in its first stages of operation at CERN, uses the SPS beam as its driver. The first run
of the experiment is set up with a $10\unit{m}$ rubidium plasma cell, with a nominal plasma density of
$7\nexp{14}\unit{cm}^{-3}$ \cite{gschwendtner:2016}. The corresponding plasma wavelength is $1.26\unit{mm}$. The plasma
density is matched to the SPS proton beam such that $k_{pe}\sigma_{r} = 1$ where $k_{pe} = \lambda_{pe}/2\pi$ is the
plasma wave number. The aim of the first run is to demonstrate self-modulation of the proton beam, and in 2018 to
sample the wake field with a long electron bunch. The study presented here is for run two, which aims to demonstrate
acceleration of a short electron bunch producing at high energy and low emittance and low energy spread.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth,trim={1mm 2mm 1mm 2mm},clip]{figures/figAWAKE}
    \caption{\label{Fig:AWAKER2} A simplified illustration of the experimental setup for AWAKE Run 2. The SPS proton
        beam undergoes self-modulation in the first $4\unit{m}$ plasma cell. The electron witness beam is injected in
        one of the buckets, and undergoes acceleration in the second plasma cell \cite{berglyd_olsen:2015, adli:2016}.}
\end{figure}

The preliminary design of the second run proposes to use two plasma sections, illustrated in figure \ref{Fig:AWAKER2}.
The first section of $4\unit{m}$ is the self-modulation stage. The electron beam will be injected into the modulated
proton beam before stage two, where acceleration will occur. As the $e_z$ field will decrease due to the gap between the
two cells, it is desirable to keep this as short as possible \cite{adli:2016}.

%- explain analogy of short-bunch, SMI case, by referring to earlier Veronica-papers
%- simulation setup PIC/quickpic OS
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

The main focus of this study has been on the beam loading of the electron beam. In order to eliminate other factors that
may affect this, we have tried several approaches to create a stable drive beam structure based on previous SMI studies.

Our first approach was to use a pre-modulated, short proton beam with similar structure to the one produced by the
self-modulation of the SPS beam in AWAKE. These studies were done using the full PIC code Osiris \cite{fonseca:2002}
using 2D cylindrical-symmetric simulations. The proton beam was pre-modulated by a clipped cosine function to the
longitudinal density profile, with a period matching $\lambda_{pe}$. Its transverse profile was kept as a Gaussian with
$\sigma_{r} = k_{pe} = 200\unit{\mu m}$. The length of the simulation beam was limited to $26\cdot\lambda_{pe}$, and the
electron beam injected after the 20th micro-bunch \cite{berglyd_olsen:2015}. We performed several parameter scans with
this setup, testing for the the maximum beam charge that could be accelerated with a high energy gain and low energy
spread \cite{adli:2016, berglyd_olsen:2016}.

In order to evaluate the quality of the beam, we also needed to study emittance evolution. However, full PIC codes like
Osiris are vulnerable to numerical growth of emittance caused by the ``numerical Cherenkov effect'' \cite{godfrey:1974}.
This is a know issue with the Yee EMF solver, which causes the phase velocity of electromagnetic fields to be lower than
$c$ while the beam moves very close to $c$. The effect can be mitigated somewhat by replacing the Yee solver with a
solver designed by Lehe \cite{lehe:2013}. These simulations showed that this numerical effect is still prominent in the
high density regions of the electron beam, making it difficult to distinguish the physics from the numerical error.

Quasi-static PIC codes do not suffer this problem, so in order to study the emittance evolution of the beam we instead
turned to the recently released open source version QuickPIC developed by UCLA. QuickPIC a fully relativistic 3D PIC
code \cite{huang:2006, an:2013}.

% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

In these simulations we use a single proton drive bunch that sets up a wakefield comparable to that which we expect to
see from the self-modulated SPS beam in AWAKE. The baseline AWAKE drive beam contains $3\nexp{11}$ protons
\cite{gschwendtner:2016}. Only half of these are driving the wakefield, presuming the self-modulation is seeded in the
middle of the unmodulated bunch. In addition. a significant portion of the protons are lost during self-modulation. The
needed gap between the two plasma cells also contributes to a decreased density of protons near the axis, and some of
the field is drained by other protons seeing an accelerating phase within the drive beam. In total, the expected peak
$E_{z}$ field of $~2\funit{GV}{m}$ in the first plasma cell drops to $500-600\funit{MV}{m}$ in the second cell
\cite{awake_collaboration:2016}. A single proton beam of $1.46\nexp{10}$, or $2.34\unit{nC}$ and $7\unit{kA}$, is needed
to drive an $E_{z}$ field of a comparable magnitude.

The single bunch approach was chosen to reduce simulation time for the 3D simulations, and to create a stable
environment for the witness beam. We are not considering the evolution of the proton beam in this test setup, so to
prevent the proton beam from evolving radially, we also increased its mass.

The baseline AWAKE drive beam current is insufficient to reach the non-linear regime and produce a plasma bubble. The
plasma electrons are depleted to around $65\%$ of nominal plasma density at the injection point of the electron beam.
This condition is replicated in out single bunch case as the peak density of the drive beam is $0.83\cdot n_{0}$. The
single bunch setup uses the baseline proton energy $W_{pb} = 400\unit{GeV}$, and retains the transverse size
$\sigma_{r} = k_{pe} = 200\unit{\mu m}$. The length of the bunch $\sigma_{z} = 40\unit{\mu m}$.

% ******************************************************************************************************************** %
\subsection[\label{S:M:Setup}]{Witness Beam Parameters}
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

The witness beam in our simulation differs from AWAKE baseline parameters on several key points. Initial beam energy is
set such that $\gamma_{eb} = \gamma_{pb} = 426.3$. This was done to eliminate the problem of initial de-phasing of the
witness beam. AWAKE baseline energy for the long witness beam for Run 1 is $W_{eb} = 10-20\unit{MeV}$
\cite{gschwendtner:2016}. Beam loading of a short witness beam is sensitive to its position relative to the field
\cite{tzoufras:2009}. AWAKE Run 2 will likely require a higher initial energy, but a $W_{eb} = 30-50\unit{MeV}$ is
sufficient to minimise de-phasing as the drift $\Delta\xi \propto \gamma^{-2}$ \cite{berglyd_olsen:2015}. For this case
we have eliminated it entirely in order to reduce the number of variables in our parameter scans.

Earlier simulations with witness beam $\sigma_{r} = 100\unit{\mu m}$ caused the beam radius to undergo rapid transverse
evolution as the beam enters the plasma, reducing its $\sigma_{r}$ from $100\unit{\mu m}$ to $< 10\unit{\mu m}$
\cite{berglyd_olsen:2016}. This is due to a mismatch between beam emittance and the plasma density. This relation is
given by
\begin{align}
    \beta = \frac{\sigma_r^2}{\epsilon_g} = \frac{\lambda_pe}{2\pi}\sqrt{2\gamma_{rel}}, \label{EQ:Matched}
\end{align}
where $\lambda_{p}$ is the plasma wavelength. In these simulations we have used matched beams for emittances between
$2$ and $6\unit{\mu m}$, corresponding to $\sigma_{r}$ ranging from $5.25\unit{\mu m}$ to $9.09\unit{\mu m}$.

%~ - describe proton beam wake structure [similar to that of a modulated proton beam] (simulation results to show:
%~   unloaded wake)

The single drive beam setup is designed to behave similarly to the self-modulated case. However, since the drive beam is
prevented from significant transverse evolution, we are presented with an idealised case where the electron witness beam
sees consistent fields throughout the plasma stage. The field generated by the proton drive bunch is seen as the dotted
line in figure \ref{Fig:BeamLoading}. With a proton beam density $n_{pb} \simeq n_{0}$, we are in the quasi-linear
regime but near non-linear \cite{rosenzweig:2010}. There is some depletion of plasma electrons, but not enough to form a
bubble. The dashed green line in the lower part of figure \ref{Fig:BeamLoading} shows that the on-axis plasma density
has a depletion of $67\%$.

%~ - by varying the current of the electron beam, the electron beam may load the wake and the longitudinal field can be
%~   flatten and energy spread reduced [well known result, Tzoufras]

The witness bunch generates its own wakefield, which in the accelerating phase cancels out the $E_{z}$ field generated
by the drive bunch. For a finite length bunch this causes the particles in the tail of the witness bunch to be
accelerated less than those at the front resulting in high energy spread in exchange for high energy transfer
\cite{van_der_meer:1985}. Since $E_{z} \propto \rho_{b}$, a beam profile $\rho_{b}(\xi)$ that perfectly flattens the
accelerating field within the witness beam, reduces energy spread to zero. The ideal shape is triangular or trapezoidal
with the peak density in the direction of the beam velocity \cite{katsouleas:1987, tzoufras:2009}.

%~ - the electron beam blows out the remaining plasma electrons. The transverse fields are dominated by the linear
%~   focusing fields originating from the ion background, leading to emittance preservation of the part of the electron
%~   beam inside the bubble [loading of a quasi-linear wake, and still get emittance preservation: this is new]

        slices of $l = 4\times\Delta\xi = 18.75\unit{\mu m}$ with a $\Delta\xi$ resolution. Only slices with more than
        $100$ macro particles have been included, which accounts for the abrupt edge as well as the noise at either end

\end{figure*}

For Gaussian beams a reasonable flat field and consequently low energy spread can be achieved by controlling the charge
density. In our case, with a matched beam to the plasma density defined by equation \ref{EQ:Matched}, we are limited on
how much total charge we can accelerate. The test case shown in figures \ref{Fig:BeamLoading} and
\ref{Fig:PlasmaDenTWake} has a total charge of $100\unit{pC}$ with a $\sigma_{r}=5.23\unit{\mu m}$ matching an initial
normalised emittance $\epsilon_{0} = 2\unit{\mu m}$.

As illustrated in figure \ref{Fig:BeamPS}, our base case of a $100\unit{pC}$, $60\unit{\mu m}$ long witness beam, as
expected, shows a difference in energy transfer to the tail of the beam compared to the centre where the $E_{z}$-field
is nearly flat. Also the front of the beam has a large tail in momentum space corresponding to a smaller acceleration
gradient. The positioning of the witness beam is chosen to put the bulk of the charge as close to the peak accelerating
field as possible, but prioritising the tail end over the front as the front is in any case in the quasi-linear regime.

Due to the high charge density resulting from a very narrow beam, the witness beam's own wakefield reaches the full
non-linear regime with $n_{eb} \approx 35\times n_{0}$. The wakefield is driven by the beam's own front. The space
charge rapidly becomes high enough to start expel plasma electrons from the beam axis, and form the characteristic
electrons sheet that defines the blowout regime. As a result the plasma region reaches full depletion close to the peak
of the electron beam, which in turn generates strong focusing fields, with gradients of $20\unit{kT/m}$ near the beam
axis (see figure \ref{Fig:PlasmaDenTWake}).

%~ - the acceleration and the transverse emittance stable on long timescales (simulation results to show: transverse and
%~   longitudinal phase spaces, space long simulation)

The witness beam's self-generated bubble prevents the tailing end of the beam to see any significant emittance growth.
For the majority of the cases we studied that maintained a stable accelerating structure, about $70-80\%$ of the beam
retained its initial emittance. Figure \ref{Fig:BeamEmitt} shows the $100\unit{pC}$ and $\sigma_{z} = 60\unit{\mu m}$
case extended to a $100\unit{m}$ plasma and the drive beam energy increased to $7\unit{TeV}$ (LHC energy) to prevent
de-phasing. De-phasing for the SPS beam case starts to become significant after about $50\unit{m}$.

The on-axis density of the electron beam increases as its gamma factor increases and its transverse size decreases. The
beam radius follows the evolution given by equation \ref{EQ:Matched} with $\lambda_{pe} = \lambda_{0}$ for the section
of the beam where normalised emittance is preserved.

%~ - in this regime, emittance preservation is robustness to drive-witness offset [this is new] (simulation results to
%~   show: transverse and longitudinal phase spaces, long offset simulation)

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,trim={2mm 0mm 2mm 0mm},clip]{figures/beamQuality}
    \caption{\label{Fig:BeamQ} }
\end{figure}


Our configuration also shows some robustness to electron beam transverse offset as the bubble generated by the witness
beam wakefield follows the beam. The head of the beam does not benefit from this effect, and we see some defocusing in
this region (see bottom, right plot of figure \ref{Fig:BeamFilament}). However, since the proton wakefield creates a
quasi linear condition, we still see the head of the beam stabilising (see top, right plot of figure
\ref{Fig:BeamFilament}). The off-axis case has a larger initial emittance growth (left side plot of figure

the plasma accelerator section (figure \ref{Fig:BeamEmitt}).

%~ Sec N+1: Parameter optimization, or, parameter scaling [in this section we describe how to optimize the electron
%~ beam, and preferably some scalings]
%~ - how to select electron beam parameters:
%~ - longitudinal parameters bunch length and current (simulations results to show: overloaded/underloaded cases)
%~ - transverse parameters of electron emittance / matching [too large, outside bubble.  Do we see increased head
%~   erosion -> faster decay]?  (simulations results to show: evolution of high emittance vs low emittance cases)
%~ (- plasma density?)
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

For accelerator applications in general, and also for Run II of the AWAKE experiment, it is desirable to maximise the
charge that can be successfully accelerated in the witness bunch. However, since longitudinally constant accelerating
fields depend on both the position and the charge density of the witness beam \cite{katsouleas:1987, tzoufras:2009}.

The large number of parameters involved makes the problem difficult to solve in simulations, and difficult to measure in
experiments. For this study we limited ourselves to look at a range of initial emittances, which allows for a range of
transverse beam sizes when with a fixed $\beta$-function matched to the plasma density; and a range of beam lengths with
a maximum at the same point on the wakefield as for our reference case covered above.

The simulations for this study have been run using the open source version of QuickPIC released in early 2017 and owned
by UCLA.

These numerical simulations have been made possible through access to the Abel computing cluster in Oslo, Norway. Abel
is maintained by UNINETT Sigma2 AS and financed by the Research Council of Norway, the University of Bergen, the
University of Oslo, the University of Tromsø and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Project code:
nn9303k. Some of the simulations were also run on the student-maintained computing cluster ``Smaug'' at the University
of Oslo, Department of Physics.

The authors would also like to acknowledge the OSIRIS Consortium for providing access to the OSIRIS framework. OSIRIS
was used extensively for simulations leading up to the work presented in this paper.
