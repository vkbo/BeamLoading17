\begin{abstract}
We investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge electron beam being accelerated in quasi-linear
plasma wakefield driven by a short proton beam. The structure of the wakefield is similar to that of a long, modulated
proton beam, such as the one being studied by AWAKE.  We show that by exploiting two well known effects, full blow out
of plasma electrons by the accelerated beam, and beam loading of the wake field, the electron beam can be accelerated
without significant emittance growth.

% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

Beam driven plasma wakefield accelerators have the potential to offer compact linear accelerators with high energy
gradients, and have been of interest for several decades \cite{chen:1985}. A relativist beam travelling through a plasma
excites a strong longitudinal e-field that can be loaded by a trailing witness beam. With optimal beam loading, increase
in energy spread can be kept to a minimum. Acceleration of an electron withness beam by an electron drive beam has been
demonstrated experimentally \cite{rosenzweig:1988, blumenfeld:2007, kallos:2008} in the past. AWAKE at CERN is a proof
of concept proton driven plasma wakefield accelerator experiment \cite{awake_collaboration:2014}.

A major challenge with plasma wakefield accelerators is, however, to produce an accelerated beam while keeping growth in
energy spread and emittance as low as possible. In the well described linear case where the beam density $n_{b}$ is much
smaller than the plasma density $n_{0}$, the non-linear transverse wakefields cause emittance growth of the accelerated
beam. A finite length beam will also see a transversely varying accelerating field causing increasing energy spread
\cite{katsouleas:1987}. In the non-linear regime, where $n_{b} > n_{0}$, a bubble is formed by the transverse
oscillations of the plasma electrons forming a sheet around an evacuated area leaving only ions. The ions, assumed
stationary, form an ion channel creating a focusing force that varies linearly with radius. This produces an axially
symmetric focusing force \cite{lu:2006-1, lu:2006}.
%~ This effect also avoids the issue of increasing energy spread due to transverse beam loading. Increase in energy spread
%~ is still dependent on beam loading $E_{z}$.
%~ Ideal beam loading can be achieved by specially shaped beams that optimally flattens the field
%~ \cite{katsouleas:1987, tzoufras:2009}, but this is difficult experimentally and is not a topic explored in this paper.

A train of electron drive bunches with a separation $\lambda_{pe}$ and a length $l_{b} \ll \lambda_{pe}$, where
%~ \begin{align}
    %~ \lambda_{p} = 2\pi\frac{c}{\omega_{pe}} \label{EQ:LambdaP}

%~ and
%~ \begin{align}
    %~ \omega_{pe} = \sqrt{\frac{n_{0} e^{2}}{m_{e} \epsilon_{0}}}, \label{EQ:OmegaP}
%~ \end{align}
$\lambda_{p} = 2\pi c/\omega_{pe}$ and $\omega_{pe} = (n_{0} e^{2} / m_{e} \epsilon_{0})^{1/2}$,
will produce a field $E_{z}$ that increases for each drive bunch \cite{chen:1985}. A tailing witness beam loading the
peak accelerating phase of this field will gain energy from the wakefield from all of the drive bunches. Acceleration of
an electron witness beam driven by two electron drive beams was demonstrated at Brookhaven National Laboratory
\cite{muggli:2011}.

The energy carried by electron drive bunches used in previous experiments were typically small, on the order of
$100\unit{J}$, and the propagation length typically $<1\unit{m}$ \cite{blumenfeld:2007,caldwell:2009}. The energy of a
high-charge electron beam accelerated to $1\unit{TeV}$, similar to the beam in the international linear collider with
$1\mexp{10}$ electrons, is $1.6\unit{kJ}$. By using electron beams or lasers as drivers a large number of plasma stages
is required. How to efficiently stage plasma accelerators is challenging without reducing the effective gradient and
spoiling the beam quality \cite{steinke:2016,lindstrom:2016}. Proton drive beams available at CERN carry
significantly more energy, $19\unit{kJ}$ for the SPS beam \cite{gschwendtner:2016}, allowing for longer accelerator
stages. However, the SPS beam is orders of magnitude longer than the plasma wavelengths needed for such applications.
This issue is resolved by letting the proton beam undergo self-modulation before injecting the witness beam into one of
the buckets in the modulated structure. This self-modulation instability is caused by the transverse fields generated by
the beam acting upon the beam itself, causing regions of the beam to rapidly defocus \cite{kumar:2010}. The modulation
frequency is close to that of the plasma, and leaves a train of proton bunches along the beam axis with a surrounding
halo.
%~ De-phasing of the
%~ witness beam relative to the drive beam, caused by loss of energy in the drive beam and gain of energy in the witness
%~ beam, limits the effective length of a plasma accelerator stage.

% ******************************************************************************************************************** %
\subsection[\label{S:I:AWAKE}]{AWAKE Run 2}
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

%~ The first run of the experiment is set up with a $10\unit{m}$ rubidium vapour cell.
%~ The rubidium vapour is
%~ ionised by a $780\unit{nm}$, $4.5\unit{TW}$ peak power laser with a pulse length of $100â120\unit{fs}$.
The AWAKE experiment, currently in its first stages of operation at CERN, uses the SPS beam at $400\unit{GeV}$ as its
driver, and a nominal plasma density $7\nexp{14}\unit{cm}^{-3}$ \cite{gschwendtner:2016}. This plasma density
corresponds to a plasma wavelength $\lambda_{pe} = 1.26\unit{mm}$. The plasma density is matched to the SPS proton beam
such that $k_{pe}\sigma_{x} = 1$ where $k_{pe} = 2\pi/\lambda_{pe}$ is the plasma wave number. The aim of the first
phase of Run 1 of the experiment is to demonstrate self-modulation of the proton beam, and in 2018 to sample the
wakefield with a long electron beam. The study presented here is for Run 2 \cite{adli:2016}, which aims to demonstrate
acceleration of a short electron beam to high energy with a minimal increase in emittance and energy spread.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth,trim={1mm 2mm 1mm 2mm},clip]{figures/figAWAKE}
    \caption{\label{Fig:AWAKER2} A simplified illustration of the experimental setup for AWAKE Run 2. The SPS proton
        beam undergoes self-modulation in the first $4\unit{m}$ plasma cell. The electron witness beam is injected in
        one of the buckets, and undergoes acceleration in the second plasma cell \cite{berglyd_olsen:2015, adli:2016}.}
\end{figure}

The preliminary design of the second run proposes to use two plasma sections, illustrated in figure \ref{Fig:AWAKER2}.
The first section of $4\unit{m}$ is the self-modulation stage where the proton beam undergoes self-modulation without
the electron beam present. The electron witness beam will be injected into the modulated proton beam before stage two,
where acceleration will occur.
%~ As the $E_z$-field will decrease due to the gap between the two cells, it is desirable to
%~ keep this as short as possible.

With this experimental design the self-modulated proton beam does not produce a non-linear wakefield, and not all plasma
electrons are therefore evacuated. The result is that the focusing force will not increase linearly with radius. The
small size of the accelerating structure produced by the self-modulated beam also put constraints on the size of the
electron witness beam, and thus its charge and current, if we wish to prevent large energy spread. By matching the
transverse size to a practical emittance and the plasma density, we prevent large amplitude oscillations which may cause
additional growth in energy spread as well as in emittance.

The key idea in this paper is that while the proton beam wake is not fully blown-out leading to non-linear focusing
forces, the electron beam, if intense enough, may load the field and at the same time create its own ion bubble. As will
be shown, exploiting these two well known effect, the electron beam can be accelerated, for long distances, without
significant emittance growth.

%~ The beam matching relation is given by
%~ \begin{align}
    %~ \beta = \frac{\sigma_r^2}{\epsilon_g} = \frac{\lambda_pe}{2\pi}\sqrt{2\gamma_{rel}}, \label{EQ:Matched}
%~ \end{align}
%~ where $\lambda_{p}$ is the plasma wavelength. For a reasonable initial emittance of $2\unit{\mu m}$, this corresponds to
%~ a $\sigma_{x}$ of $5.25\unit{\mu m}$ -- a very narrow bunch compared to the drive beam $\sigma_{x} = 200\unit{\mu m}$.
%~ The charge density of this compact witness bunch reaches that of the plasma density at only a few $\unit{pC}$, but
%~ reaches optimal beam loading at around $1-200\unit{pC}$. The implication here being that the witness bunch produces its
%~ own non-linear wakefield already at the head of the bunch. The majority of the electrons within it will therefore see a
%~ linear focusing force preventing the bulk of the beam from undergoing emittance growth.

%- explain analogy of short-bunch, SMI case, by referring to earlier Veronica-papers
%- simulation setup PIC/quickpic OS
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

The main focus of this study has been on the beam loading of the electron beam. In order to eliminate other factors
that may affect this, we have tried several approaches to create a stable drive beam structure based on previous self-
modulation studies.

Our first approach was to use a pre-modulated, short proton beam with similar structure to the one produced by the
self-modulation of the SPS beam in AWAKE. These studies were done using the full PIC code Osiris \cite{fonseca:2002}
using 2D cylindrical-symmetric simulations \cite{berglyd_olsen:2015, berglyd_olsen:2016}.

%~ In order to evaluate the quality of the accelerated bunch it was also necessary to study emittance evolution. However,
%~ full PIC codes are vulnerable to numerical growth of emittance caused by the ``numerical Cherenkov effect''
%~ \cite{godfrey:1974}. This is a know issue with the Yee EMF solver which causes the phase velocity of electromagnetic
%~ fields to be lower than $c$ while the beam moves very close to $c$. The effect can be mitigated somewhat by replacing
%~ the Yee solver with a solver designed by Lehe \cite{lehe:2013}. Our simulations showed that this numerical effect is
%~ still prominent in the high density regions of our very compact electron bunch, making it difficult to distinguish
%~ emittance growth from the physics from that originating from numerical error.

In order to study the witness beam emittance evolution we turned to the recently released open source version of
QuickPIC developed by UCLA. QuickPIC is a fully relativistic 3D quasi-static PIC code \cite{huang:2006, an:2013}.
Since QuickPIC is a quasi-static code, it does not suffer from the numerical Cherenkov effect that full PIC codes do
\cite{godfrey:1974,lehe:2013}, it is well suited to study emittance preservation.

%~ Patric's Comments
%~ - Self-modulation as a driver
%~ - SM does not reach blow out
%~ - SM does not preserve emittance and produces large energy spread and parameters may evolve along the accelerator,
%~   not desirable
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

In these simulations we use a single proton drive beam that sets up a wakefield comparable to that which we expect to
see from the self-modulated SPS beam in the second plasma cell of AWAKE Run 2 (Figure \ref{Fig:AWAKER2}). When the
initial SPS beam containing $3\nexp{11}$ protons \cite{gschwendtner:2016} enters the second plasma cell the peak $E_{z}$
field is expected to be $500-600\funit{MV}{m}$. As the baseline AWAKE drive beam current is insufficient to reach the
non-linear regime and produce a plasma bubble, the plasma electrons are only depleted to around $65\%$ of nominal plasma
density at the point where we inject the electron beam \cite{awake_collaboration:2016}. These conditions are replicated
in our simulations using a single proton beam of $1.46\nexp{10}$ protons, or $2.34\unit{nC}$ and $7\unit{kA}$.

The peak density of the simulation drive beam is $0.83\cdot n_{0}$, producing a quasi-linear wakefield. The single bunch
setup uses the baseline proton energy $W_{pb} = 400\unit{GeV}$ and transverse size $\sigma_{x} = 200\unit{\mu m}$. We
set the length of the drive beam to $\sigma_{z} = 40\unit{\mu m}$. In order to create a stable environment to study the
evolution of the witness beam we prevented the proton beam from evolving radially by increasing the particle mass by a
factor of $1\mexp{6}$. We are not considering the evolution of the proton beam itself in this study.

% ******************************************************************************************************************** %
\subsection[\label{S:M:Setup}]{Witness Beam Parameters}
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

The witness beam in our simulation differs from AWAKE baseline parameters on several key points. Initial beam energy is
set such that $\gamma_{eb} = \gamma_{pb} = 426.3$. This was done to eliminate the problem of initial de-phasing of the
witness beam. Beam loading of a short witness beam is sensitive to its position relative to the field
\cite{tzoufras:2009}. The relative drift causing the de-phasing $\Delta\xi \propto \gamma^{-2}$. By simply matching the
initial $\gamma$ values we eliminate this effect entirely, but a lower initial value is likely to be sufficient
\cite{berglyd_olsen:2015}.

In these 3D simulations we have used a matched beam for an initial emittance of $2\unit{\mu m}$, corresponding to a
$\sigma_{x}$ of $5.25\unit{\mu m}$. The beam matching relation is given by
\begin{align}
    \beta = \frac{\sigma_r^2}{\epsilon_g} = \frac{\lambda_{pe}}{2\pi}\sqrt{2\gamma_{rel}}, \label{EQ:Matched}
\end{align}
where $\lambda_{p}$ is the plasma wavelength. This is a very narrow beam compared to the drive beam
$\sigma_{x} = 200\unit{\mu m}$. The charge density of this compact witness beam reaches that of the plasma density at
only a few $\unit{pC}$, but reaches optimal beam loading at around $1-200\unit{pC}$. The implication here being that the
witness beam produces its own non-linear wakefield already at the head of the beam. The majority of the electrons
within it will therefore see a linear focusing force preventing the bulk of the beam from undergoing emittance growth.

The relatively small size of the witness beam compared to the proton beam put some restrictions on the transverse
resolution of the witness beam. We used a transverse grid cell size of $1.17\unit{\mu m}$, and $2.34\unit{\mu m}$ for
the longitudinal grid cells. The witness beam was simulated with $16.8\unit{M}$ non-weighted particles.

In the following section we study a witness beam with a total charge of $100\unit{pC}$, a $\sigma_{z}=60\unit{\mu m}$,
and with a $\sigma_{x}=5.23\unit{\mu m}$ matching an initial normalised emittance $\epsilon_{0} = 2\unit{\mu m}$. We
refer to this parameter set as our base case.

\end{figure}

%~ - describe proton beam wake structure [similar to that of a modulated proton beam] (simulation results to show:
%~   unloaded wake)

The single drive beam setup is designed to behave similarly to the self-modulated case. However, since the drive beam is
prevented from significant transverse evolution, we are presented with an idealised case where the electron witness beam
sees consistent wakefields throughout the plasma stage. The $E_{z}$-field generated by the proton drive beam is seen as
the blue line in figure \ref{Fig:BeamLoading}, shown with and without the electron beam present. With a proton beam
density $n_{pb} \simeq n_{0}$, we are in the quasi-linear regime but near non-linear \cite{rosenzweig:2010}. The dashed
green line in the lower part of figure \ref{Fig:BeamLoading} shows that the on-axis plasma density has a depletion of
$67\%$, close to what we see in full scale reference simulations for AWAKE Run 2 \cite{awake_collaboration:2016}.

%~ - by varying the current of the electron beam, the electron beam may load the wake and the longitudinal field can be
%~   flatten and energy spread reduced [well known result, Tzoufras]

%~ The witness beam generates its own wakefield, which in the accelerating phase partially cancels out the $E_{z}$ field
%~ generated by the drive beam. For a finite length beam this causes the particles in the tail of the witness beam to be
%~ accelerated less than those at the front resulting in higher energy spread in exchange for higher energy transfer
%~ \cite{van_der_meer:1985}. A beam profile $\rho_{b}(\xi)$ that perfectly flattens the
%~ accelerating field within the witness beam will reduces energy spread to zero. The ideal shape is triangular or
%~ trapezoidal with the peak density in the direction of the beam velocity \cite{katsouleas:1987, tzoufras:2009}.

The witness beam generates its own wakefield which partially cancels out the $E_{z}$ field generated by the drive beam.
With an ideally shaped electron beam charge profile it is possible to optimally load the field, such that the
accelerating $E_{z}$ is constant along the bunch \cite{katsouleas:1987, tzoufras:2009}.

%~ - the electron beam blows out the remaining plasma electrons. The transverse fields are dominated by the linear
%~   focusing fields originating from the ion background, leading to emittance preservation of the part of the electron
%~   beam inside the bubble [loading of a quasi-linear wake, and still get emittance preservation: this is new]
%~   (simulation results to show: loaded wake, with bubble - many different aspects of this, trans., long. field,
%~   electron densities etc. )

        slices of $l = 4\times\Delta\xi = 18.75\unit{\mu m}$ with a $\Delta\xi$ resolution. Only slices with more than
        $100$ macro particles have been included, which accounts for the abrupt edge as well as the noise at either end
        of the beam due to low statistics. The blue lines show the peak electron beam density profile. For reference,
        the plasma density profile is included in green, but scaled up by a factor of $100$ to be visible. The solid
        lines are at the plasma entry point, the dashed lines after $4\unit{m}$ of plasma, the dash-dotted after
        $40\unit{m}$, and the dotted after $100\unit{m}$. In order to sustain a stable accelerating field for the
        witness beam, these simulations were run with an LHC energy drive beam of $7\unit{TeV}$ to avoid de-phasing
        which causes the structure to break down after about $50\unit{m}$.}

While the ideal shape is trapezodial, for Gaussians beams a reasonable flat field, and consequently low energy spread,
can be achieved by controlling the charge density to achieve a similar effect. This, however, puts the front of the
witness beam outside of the ideal region while the middle bulk of the beam has a trapezoidal-like shape. In our case,
with a matched beam to the plasma density defined by equation \ref{EQ:Matched}, we are limited on how much total charge
we can accelerate without reaching charge densities that will overload the field.

As illustrated in figure \ref{Fig:BeamPS} our base case shows a difference in energy transfer to the tail of the beam
compared to the centre where the $E_{z}$-field is nearly flat. Also the front of the beam has a large tail in momentum
space as this regions sees a smaller accelerating field. The positioning of the witness beam is chosen to put the bulk
of the charge as close to the peak accelerating field as possible.

The charge density required to optimally load the $E_{z}$ field is $n_{eb} \approx 35\times n_{0}$. This means that the
witness beam's own wakefield is in the fully non-linear regime, where the space charge force is sufficient to blow-out
all plasma electrons resulting in an ion column. This ion column, as is well known \cite{rosenzweig:1991}, provides a
linear focusing force on the part the electron beam within the ion column, and therefore prevents emittance growth for
this region. This effect is shown for our base case in figure \ref{Fig:PlasmaDenTWake}. The focusing field has a
gradient of $20\unit{kT/m}$ near the beam axis.

%~ Due to the high charge density resulting from a very narrow beam, the witness beam's own wakefield reaches the full
%~ non-linear regime with $n_{eb} \approx 35\times n_{0}$. This second wakefield is driven by the beam's own front. The
%~ space charge rapidly becomes high enough to start expel plasma electrons from the beam axis and form the characteristic
%~ electrons sheet that defines the blowout regime. As a result the plasma region reaches full depletion close to the peak
%~ of the electron beam, which in turn generates strong focusing fields, with gradients of $20\unit{kT/m}$ near the beam
%~ axis (see figure \ref{Fig:PlasmaDenTWake}).

%~ - the acceleration and the transverse emittance stable on long timescales (simulation results to show: transverse and
%~   longitudinal phase spaces, space long simulation)

%~ The witness beam's self-generated bubble prevents the tailing end of the beam to see any significant emittance growth.
For the majority of the cases we studied that maintained a stable accelerating structure, about $70-80\%$ of the beam
retained its initial emittance. Figure \ref{Fig:BeamEmitt} shows emittance growth for the base case as a function of
propagation length. No significant emittance growth was observed for propagation lengths up to $100\unit{m}$. The drive
beam energy increased to $7\unit{TeV}$ (LHC energy) to prevent de-phasing. De-phasing for the SPS beam case starts to
become significant after about $50\unit{m}$.

The on-axis density of the electron beam increases as its gamma factor increases and its transverse size decreases. The
beam radius follows the evolution given by equation \ref{EQ:Matched} with $\lambda_{pe} = \lambda_{0}$ for the section
of the beam where normalised emittance is preserved as shown in figure \ref{Fig:BeamFilament}. This has the potential to
cause overloading of the field. However, for our base case this effect is not significant.

%~ - in this regime, emittance preservation is robustness to drive-witness offset [this is new] (simulation results to
%~   show: transverse and longitudinal phase spaces, long offset simulation)

%~ Our configuration also shows some robustness to small electron beam transverse offsets as the bubble generated by the
%~ witness beam wakefield follows the beam itself.

Since the accelerated electron beam creates its own focusing bubble, the emittance of the part of the beam inside the
bubble is not affected by small beam offsets with respect to the proton beam axis. This is an added benefit of this new
accelerating regime, and may ease the transverse injection tolerances. The head of the beam does not benefit from this
effect, but since the proton beam creates a quasi linear wake, the head of the beam still stabilises after some time.
This is illustrated on figure \ref{Fig:BeamEmitt} for an electron beam offset of $1\sigma_{x}$. In this case there is a
larger initial emittance growth (see left hand plots of figure \ref{Fig:BeamFilament}), but the emittance growth stop
after the first few metres (figure \ref{Fig:BeamEmitt}). This effect is likely to be greater for larger offsets as the
beam oscillates around the axis of the drive beam wakefield (see right hand plots of figure \ref{Fig:BeamFilament}).

The beam loading and blow out properties of the electron beam depends on a large number of parameters: the longitudinal
profile, the transverse profile as well as the relative phasing of the proton and the electron beams.

We here study parameter optimization relevant for AWAKE Run 2, in order to understand the ideal injection parameters.
For AWAKE Run 2 we desire to maximize the energy gain, minimize the energy spread, maximize the charge to be accelerated
and minimize the emittance growth. In addition, the bunch length should be such that it is possible to generate and
transport by a compact electron injector \cite{adli:2016}. These are contradictory constraints. We  investigate the
interdependence of these parameters by simulation. We vary the electron bunch length, charge and initial emittance. We
quantify the resulting emittance growth, energy spread and and energy gain. The desired injection parameters will depend
on the application.

Figures \ref{Fig:BeamQ} and \ref{Fig:BeamQAbs} show the dependence on bunch length and bunch charge for an initial beam
emittance of $2\unit{\mu m}$ after propagating through $4\unit{m}$ of plasma. We ran the scan with beam charges from
$10\unit{pC}$ to $300\unit{pC}$ and with length $\sigma_{z}$ from $40\unit{\mu m}$ to $100\unit{\mu m}$. We see from
figure \ref{Fig:BeamQ} that both the $40\unit{\mu m}$ and the $60\unit{\mu m}$ beam has a well defined minimum energy
spread with a beam charge $\geq 50\unit{pC}$ and $\approx 100\unit{pC}$ respectively. Lower beam charges tend to
underload the $E_{z}$-field, while higher beam charges tend to overload it. It is also clear that long beams with
respect to the accelerating flank of the $E_{z}$-field, $\approx\lambda_{pe}/4$, will not optimally load the field along
its length thus experiencing a larger spread in energy.

        of plasma.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Fig:BeamQEmit} shows how the growth in emittance and energy spread varies with initial electron beam
emittance. The smaller the initial emittance is, the better the emittance is preserved. There are two effects that lead
to growth for high emittance beams; the transverse beam size may increase beyond the size of the bubble, or the beam
density may be reduced so much that the plasma electrons are no longer fully evacuated from the ion column. Emittance
values higher than a few micrometers lead to a significant increase in both emittance and energy spread. In these
simulations the focusing of the beam to the plasma remains matched for each emittance value.

\section[\label{S:C}]{Conclusion}
% ******************************************************************************************************************** %

We have studied a new plasma wakefield acceleration regime; acceleration of a strongly loaded electron beam in a quasi-
linear proton driven wake. When optimally loaded, the electron beam creates its own ion bubble, yielding emittance
preservation for a large parts of the electron beam.

These result indicates that emittance preservation for an on-axis injected electron beam, properly optimized, is
feasible. Parameter studies indicate that up to a few $100\unit{pC}$ might be accelerated, for bunches of length
$40-60\unit{\mu m}$. Such an electron bunch may be generated by a standard S-band RF gun.

As this study assumes a wake driven by a single, short proton beam, the studies for interesting cases for AWAKE should
be repeated by a full simulation of a self-modulated proton beam.
